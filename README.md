# Dictionary
I created EngiWords, a dictionary using Python in Thonny on my laptop. The program stores and retrieves definitions of engineering related terms using a dictionary data structure. It takes user input and returns the definition of searched term and if the term does not exist they will get informed. It is also easy to quit or close the program.
